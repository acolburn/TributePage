            <p>I am a Professor of Science Education. Before coming to CSULB in 1995 I taught in the Science Education Center
                at the University of Iowa–where I received my Ph.D. (in Science Education) in 1991. I also have a master’s
                degree in Biology, taught high school Chemistry in Haverford, PA, and briefly taught Physical Science in
                Iowa City.</p>
            <p>I have taught a variety of courses at CSULB, but mostly SCED 401, 550, and (until recently) 404. SCED 401 is
                a science class for prospective elementary teachers. SCED 550 is the first class new graduate students take.
                SCED 404 is about the nature of science and scientific reasoning. I also work with graduate students and
                supervise student teachers. I am a recipient of the Distinguished Faculty Teaching Award. </p>
            <p>Beside these duties I am graduate adviser to our master’s degree program, serve on various university committees,
                and review articles for professional journals. My research interests include inquiry-based science teaching,
                misconceptions, the nature of science, and issues related to evolution, creationism, science & religion.
                I’ve written articles and given professional presentations and workshops.</p>
            <p>I wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lingo-Learning-Education-Science-Teacher/dp/0873552288/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1493506634&sr=8-3"
                    target="_blank">The Lingo of Learning: 88 terms every science teacher should know</a>, which explains educational
                “jargon” in plain English and provides fairly brief introductions to common teaching-related ideas. I also
                wrote the monthly <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Ansta.org+%22The+Prepared+Practitioner%22&t=ffab&ia=web"
                    target="_blank">Prepared Practitioner column</a> in The Science Teacher from 2007-2010. In 2016 I wrote

                    target="_blank">Learning Science by Doing Science: 10 classic activities reimagined to show how science really works</a>.
                    It was influenced by my experiences teaching SCED 401, published early in 2017.</p>
            <p>I’m dedicated to helping students have great experiencse with the classes they take from me. You can always reach
                me by email, <a href="mailto:alan.colburn@csulb.edu" target="_blank">alan.colburn@csulb.edu</a>.</p>
